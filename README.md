# Affects-of-Temperature
Is there an effect of weather and temperature on the rate of crime? 
Adding interaction terms like Temp_Crime_Interaction in the dataset can help capture the combined effect of two variables on the outcome. In this case, we're looking at how temperature (Temp) and the number of crimes (NumberofCrimes) together influence a particular outcome.
By creating this interaction term, we can analyze whether the relationship between temperature and crime rate changes when both variables are considered together, rather than independently. This can provide deeper insights into patterns and correlations that might not be apparent when looking at each variable separately.
After the analysis, it is found that as the temperature increases, the number of crimes also increases.
